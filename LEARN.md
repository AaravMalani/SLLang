# SLLang : Method
Over the summer I decided I wanted to create a simple programming langauge in C (as my base), with more readability than C, while also retaining a fair amount of speed. 
I implemented this through many different tutorials (there was an amazing FreeCodeCamp one with an explanation of the different parts of a programming language), but in the end I was stuck with doing most of the coding as there weren't too many tutorials for creating a programming language in C. 

For people checking this out; I'd reccomend programming this in C++ if you haven't done much C programming before, it requires you to have knowledge about a lot of different topics of C. But it is a cool project to help learn low-level development while also doing something fun as well!

I will be putting out a couple of tutorial/explanation documents soon, so feel free to check those out.
