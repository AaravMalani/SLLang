# SLLang
Over the Summer I decided to look into how programming languages work, including the operation of **kernels** and how the interaction between the language and hardware works. 

I decidde to undertake a very long project, on creating my own programming language from scratch. Implementing things like **lexers, parsers, AST things etc.** 

I programmed it in C, in order to improve some of my lower-level programming skills; but I also did it because it is my language of choice. 

Feel free to clone the repository, run the makefile; and use my language... SLLlang!
